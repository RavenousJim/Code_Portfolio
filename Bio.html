	 	Having been a political professional for over a decade, I have worked my way from entry level positions to creating my own political action committee. While doing this, I have continued to work in the construction trades to generate capital and also maintain my basic needs.Though my education culminated with a Bachelor's degree in political science, which I earned at the University of Cincinnati, participating in commencement in 2006, I look forward to new and exciting challenges in multiple fields. Ideally, I’d love to have an employment opportunity providing the mutually beneficial situation with balance between compensation, dedication, and full commitment to my job, never doubting my employer’s reciprocity in its  commitment and dedication to the success of its employees, providing performance based incentives for upward mobility.
