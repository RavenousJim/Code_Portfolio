	</div>
<h2 class="text-center"> In the early Nineties being a skateboarder came with being a complete outsider, being different. So the full-on teen skate-nerd that I was, opening up the magazine pages was opening the door to a universe where being different and basically not giving a fuck was glorified and taken to extreme. A universe of skateboarding on and off the board, excitement and thrill, nonsense and dumb shit! just about everything you want growing up. So soon enough Big Brother became educational literature for a whole generation of skateboarders.</h2>

<p class="text-center text-white bg-dark">Big Brother consistently challenged notions of decency. They were wild to say the least. Among their reveared video releases were given the apt titles "poop," "crap," and "shit." Coincindentally, Big Brother is remembered fondly by peers that grew up reading it.
